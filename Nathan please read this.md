I checked the lab instructions and  all that is left for you to do is
1. Update the output string at the end of the "Program" class to display the result value with a decimal precision of two
2. Move the "CalculatorEngine" class into its own project and reference it in the main project
3. Implement i18n in English and French for all text prompts

For the "extra" thing the teacher wanted you to do you could make it so the programs prompts the user 
to input what language (English or French) they want to use before they input their numbers.
